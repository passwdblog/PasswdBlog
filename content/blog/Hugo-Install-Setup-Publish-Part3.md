## Build the site first time

Before we build our site for the first time we are going to make a small change to the config.toml file to build the site into ```docs``` instead of the traditional ```public``` sub-folder. This is to allow us to work with GitHub's Pages hosting service that expects a docs folder.
```
REM Add the following line to config.toml

publishDir = "docs"

REM Save the config.toml file
```

We are now ready to build the site.

```
REM Build the site for the first time by running just hugo by itself
C:\Hufo\Sites\PasswdTest.Blog>hugo

```
You should now see a ```docs``` folder in C:\Hugo\Sites\PasswdTest.Blog\ 

This folder contains the compiled site that can be hosted on various platforms, we are going to us GitHub Pages to host our site.

## Adding the published site to GitHub
```
REM Add the new files to git
C:\Hugo\Sites\PasswdTest.Blog> git add .


C:\Hugo\Sites\PasswdTest.Blog> git commit -m "Initial Docs Commit"

C:\Hugo\Sites\PasswdTest.Blog> git push --force origin master

TODO: Explain about the error without force. Only an issue if multiple people contribute.
```

Refresh your GitHub repository, you should now have a docs folder.

Click on ```Settings``` in the repository view of GitHub. Scroll down to GitHub Pages and click on ```None``` under Source.

Select ```master brance /docs folder```. The page will refresh, scroll down again and enter your custom domain name in the field, check Enforce HTTPS and click save.

You will now be able to browse to your domain and see the sample tempate site.


# Ongoing editing and publishing
Browse to the docs folder in your GitHub repository. You will see a CNAME file that was generated by GitHub when you saved you domain name in the previous section.

The recomendation from Hugo is to delete the public or docs folder before every build, otherwise any deleted files will remain on the published site.

When deteting the docs folder the generated CNAME file will also be deleted and you will have to enter the domain name again.

To streamline the process we are going to create the CNAME file using a deply script.

The ```deploy-passwdtemp.blog.bat``` file below will allow you to automate the deployment process.

Place the batch file in the C:\Hugo\Sites directory!!

```
@ECHO OFF

ECHO "STEP 1 - Removing the previous docs folder"
rd /S /Q C:\Hugo\Sites\PasswdTest.Blog\docs

C:
cd Hugo\Sites\PasswdTest.Blog


ECHO "STEP 2 - Building the site with hugo"
hugo


ECHO "STEP 3 - Add the CNAME file"
ECHO Passwd.Blog > C:\Hugo\Sites\PasswdBlog\CNAME


ECHO "STEP 4 - Setting Git Parameters"
git config user.name "your_github_username"
git config user.email "your_github_email@domain.com"

ECHO "STEP 5 - Git add ."
git add .


ECHO "STEP 6 - git commit (Use the current date and time in the commit comment)"
set backupFilename="rebuilding site %DATE:~10,4%-%DATE:~4,2%-%DATE:~7,2% @ %time:~0,2%:%time:~3,2%:%time:~6,2%"
git commit -m %backupFilename%


ECHO "STEP 7 - git push"
git push --force origin master

cd ..
```

Once you have completed editing your site content, just run ```deploy-passwdtemp.blog.bat``` from C:\Hugo\Sites
