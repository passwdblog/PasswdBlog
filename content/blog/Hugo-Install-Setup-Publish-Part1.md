# Introduction
This post is somewhat meta, it describes my journey installing  ``` hugo ```, setting up Hugo on my authoring **machines** and publishing the site to GitHub pages using a custom domain. 

I will detail both [Windows 10]({{<ref "#windows" >}}) and [Ubuntu-19.10]({{<ref "#ubuntu" >}}) setups. 

I found a lot of very good information on the web, but found it a bit fragmented and made a lot of assumptions, especially as far as ```git``` knowledge is concerned.  

Click [here]({{<relref "/blog/Hugo-Install-Setup-Publish-Part1.md">}}) for Part 1.
### In Part 1
1. Installing Hugo
2. Configuring Hugo
3. Creating a Hugo Site

Click [here]({{<relref "/blog/Hugo-Install-Setup-Publish-Part2.md">}}) for Part 2.
### In Part 2
1. Installing Git
2. Setting up GitHub
3. Setting up Git to work with Hugo
4. Installing a Theme
5. Running the site for the first time
6. Pushing all the code to GitHub

Click [here]({{<relref "/blog/Hugo-Install-Setup-Publish-Part3.md">}}) for Part 3.
### In Part 3
1. Build the site for the first time
2. Adding the published site to GitHub
3. Ongoing editing and publishing

# windows
## Windows 10 Setup
In this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the ">" prompt. For example: ```C:\Hugo\Sites>``` The output will follow. Lines that start with "REM" are comments that I've added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the ```[SAVE&EXIT]``` on the last line means to save the file and exit from the editor.

Here's an example:

```
REM this is a comment
C:\Hugo> echo this is a command
this is a command

REM edit the file
C:\Hugo>notepad foo.md
+++
date = "2019-11-01"
title = "creating a post"
+++

Text in the post goes here....
[SAVE&EXIT]

REM show it
$ type foo.md
+++
date = "2019-11-01"
title = "creating a post"
+++

Text in the post goes here....
C:\Hugo>
```

## Assumptions
1. You will use ```C:\Hugo\Sites``` as the starting point for your new project.
2. You will use ```C:\Hugo\bin``` to store executable files
3. I am using ```PasswdTest.Blog``` as the name of my site, directories, etc. Substitute your site wherever you see PasswdTest.Blog.
4. You will be publishing your site to GitHub Pages using a custom domain name.
5. You have an account on GitHub.

## Check if hugo is installed
```
REM run the command from a dos prompt
C:\Hugo>hugo --help

hugo is the main command, used to build your Hugo site.

etc

```
If you see the text above then Hugo is installed and working correctly.

## Installing Hugo
If you don't have hugo installed, download the latest version from https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases

On Windows 10 the file is called ```hugo_extended_0.59.1_Windows-64bit.zip```

Create the following directories:
```
REM create C:\Hugo and C:\Hugo\bin directories
C:\>md Hugo
C:\Hugo>md bin
```

Unzip the downloaded file into the ```C:\Hugo\bin\``` folder. You should now have three files in the folder:
```
C:\Hugo\bin>dir
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is A4A4-A8FE

 Directory of C:\Hugo\bin

02/11/2019  11:14 PM    <DIR>          .
02/11/2019  11:14 PM    <DIR>          ..
21/10/2019  08:41 PM        38,937,088 hugo.exe
21/10/2019  08:33 PM            11,357 LICENSE
21/10/2019  08:33 PM            11,235 README.md
               3 File(s)     38,959,680 bytes
               4 Dir(s)  83,648,753,664 bytes free
```

If you run ```hugo --help``` now you should see the output in the section above. The command will only work from the ```C:\Hugo\Bin\``` directory since Windows will not be able to find from anywhere else in your system. 

To fix this we will add the path to hugo to Windows' ```%PATH%``` variable.

## Adding hugo.exe to the Windows %PATH% variable

1. Right click on the ```This PC``` icon.
2. Click on Advanced System Settings on the left.
3. Click on the Environment Variablesâ€¦ button on the bottom.
4. In the User variables section, find the row that starts with PATH.
5. Double-click on PATH.
6. Click the ```New``` button.
7. Type ```C:\Hugo\bin``` and click OK.
8. Click OK at every window to exit.
9. Open a new Command Prompt window and type ```hugo --help``` to make sure the path works.


# Creating your hugo site
Now we can start to create your site. To keep things neat we will store all our sites in the ```C:\Hugo\Sites``` directory.

```
C:\Hugo>md Sites

cd Sites

C:\Hugo\Sites>
```

Run the command to generate a new site. I am using ```PasswdTest.Blog``` as the name of the site.
```

C:\Hugo\Sites> hugo new site PasswdTest.Blog


Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in C:\Hugo\Sites\PasswdTest.Blog.

Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or
   create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>\<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.

```

You should now have a directory at ```C:\Hugo\Sites\PasswdTest.Blog```. Change into that directory and list the contents. Your output should look similar to the following:
```
C:\Hugo\Sites> cd PasswdTest.Blog

C:\Hugo\Sites\PasswdTest.Blog> dir

 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is A4A4-A8FE

 Directory of C:\Hugo\Sites\PasswdTest.Blog

03/11/2019  08:26 AM    <DIR>          .
03/11/2019  08:26 AM    <DIR>          ..
03/11/2019  08:26 AM    <DIR>          archetypes
03/11/2019  08:26 AM                82 config.toml
03/11/2019  08:26 AM    <DIR>          content
03/11/2019  08:26 AM    <DIR>          data
03/11/2019  08:26 AM    <DIR>          layouts
03/11/2019  08:26 AM    <DIR>          static
03/11/2019  08:26 AM    <DIR>          themes
               1 File(s)             82 bytes
               8 Dir(s)  83,632,214,016 bytes free

# ubuntu
## Ubuntu 19.10 Linux Setup
In this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the "$" prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with "#" are comments that I've added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the ":wq" on the last line means to save the file.


Here's an example:

```
## this is a comment
$ echo this is a command
this is a command

## edit the file
$vi foo.md
+++
date = "2019-11-01"
title = "creating a post"
+++

Text in the post goes here....
:wq

## show it
$ cat foo.md
+++
date = "2014-09-28"
title = "creating a post"
+++

Text in the post goes here....
$
```

## Assumptions
1. You will use your "home" directory ```/home/user``` as the starting point for your new project.
2. I am using ```PasswdTest.Blog``` as the name of my site, directories, etc. Substitute your site wherever you see PasswdTest.Blog.
3. You will be publishing your site to GitHub Pages using a custom domain name.
4. You have an account on GitHub.

## Check if hugo is installed
```
# run the command from a terminal window
$ hugo --help

If you see the text above then Hugo is installed and working correctly.

## Installing Hugo
If you don't have hugo installed, enter the command below:

```
# install hugo via snap
$ sudo snap install hugo
hugo 0.59.1 from Hugo Authers installed
```

There are various other ways to install hugo, flex your <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Google-fu" target="_blank">Google-Fu</a>.

You can now try to run ```hugo --help``` again from a terminal and you should see the output above if the installation was successful.

# Creating your hugo site
Now we can start to create your site. To keep things simple we will store all our sites in the "home" directory ```/home/user``` or ```~/```. Wherever we use ```~``` in the tutorial we mean ```/home/user```, everything will be relative to that path.

```
~$ mkdir Sites

cd Sites

~/Sites$
```

Run the command to generate a new site. I am using ```PasswdTest.Blog``` as the name of the site.
```

~/Sites$ hugo new site PasswdTest.Blog
