# Introduction
This post is somewhat meta, it describes my journey installing  ``` hugo ```, setting up Hugo on my authoring **machines** and publishing the site to GitHub pages using a custom domain. 

I will detail both [Windows 10]({{<ref "#windows" >}}) and [Ubuntu-19.10]({{<ref "#ubuntu" >}}) setups. 

I found a lot of very good information on the web, but found it a bit fragmented and made a lot of assumptions, especially as far as ```git``` knowledge is concerned.  

___

# windows
## Windows 10 Setup
In this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the ">" prompt. For example: ```C:\Hugo\Sites>``` The output will follow. Lines that start with "REM" are comments that I've added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the ```[SAVE&EXIT]``` on the last line means to save the file and exit from the editor.

Here's an example:

```
REM this is a comment
C:\Hugo> echo this is a command
this is a command

REM edit the file
C:\Hugo>notepad foo.md
+++
date = "2019-11-01"
title = "creating a post"
+++

Text in the post goes here....
[SAVE&EXIT]

REM show it
$ type foo.md
+++
date = "2019-11-01"
title = "creating a post"
+++

Text in the post goes here....
C:\Hugo>
```

## Assumptions
1. You will use ```C:\Hugo\Sites``` as the starting point for your new project.
2. You will use ```C:\Hugo\bin``` to store executable files
3. I am using ```PasswdTest.Blog``` as the name of my site, directories, etc. Substitute your site wherever you see PasswdTest.Blog.
4. You will be publishing your site to GitHub Pages using a custom domain name.
5. You have git installed and working, if you don't follow my tutorial [here]({{<relref "/blog/Git-Install.md">}}).
6. You have an account on GitHub.

## Check if hugo is installed
```
REM run the command from a dos prompt
C:\Hugo>hugo --help

hugo is the main command, used to build your Hugo site.

Hugo is a Fast and Flexible Static Site Generator
built with love by spf13 and friends in Go.

Complete documentation is available at http://gohugo.io/.

...
etc
...

```
If you see the text above then Hugo is installed and working correctly.

## Installing Hugo
If you don't have hugo installed, download the latest version from https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases

On Windows 10 the file is called ```hugo_extended_0.59.1_Windows-64bit.zip```

Create the following directories:
```
REM create C:\Hugo and C:\Hugo\bin directories
C:\>md Hugo
C:\Hugo>md bin
```

Unzip the downloaded file into the ```C:\Hugo\bin\``` folder. You should now have three files in the folder:
```
C:\Hugo\bin>dir
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is A4A4-A8FE

 Directory of C:\Hugo\bin

02/11/2019  11:14 PM    <DIR>          .
02/11/2019  11:14 PM    <DIR>          ..
21/10/2019  08:41 PM        38,937,088 hugo.exe
21/10/2019  08:33 PM            11,357 LICENSE
21/10/2019  08:33 PM            11,235 README.md
               3 File(s)     38,959,680 bytes
               4 Dir(s)  83,648,753,664 bytes free
```

If you run ```hugo --help``` now you should see the output in the section above. The command will only work from the ```C:\Hugo\Bin\``` directory since Windows will not be able to find from anywhere else in your system. 

To fix this we will add the path to hugo to Windows' ```%PATH%``` variable.

## Adding hugo.exe to the Windows %PATH% variable

1. Right click on the ```This PC``` icon.
2. Click on Advanced System Settings on the left.
3. Click on the Environment Variablesâ€¦ button on the bottom.
4. In the User variables section, find the row that starts with PATH.
5. Double-click on PATH.
6. Click the ```New``` button.
7. Type ```C:\Hugo\bin``` and click OK.
8. Click OK at every window to exit.
9. Open a new Command Prompt window and type ```hugo --help``` to make sure the path works.


# Creating your hugo site
Now we can start to create your site. To keep things neat we will store all our sites in the ```C:\Hugo\Sites``` directory.

```
C:\Hugo>md Sites

cd Sites

C:\Hugo\Sites>
```

Run the command to generate a new site. I am using ```PasswdTest.Blog``` as the name of the site.
```

C:\Hugo\Sites> hugo new site PasswdTest.Blog


Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in C:\Hugo\Sites\PasswdTest.Blog.

Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or
   create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>\<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.

```

You should now have a directory at ```C:\Hugo\Sites\PasswdTest.Blog```. Change into that directory and list the contents. Your output should look similar to the following:
```
C:\Hugo\Sites> cd PasswdTest.Blog

C:\Hugo\Sites\PasswdTest.Blog> dir

 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is A4A4-A8FE

 Directory of C:\Hugo\Sites\PasswdTest.Blog

03/11/2019  08:26 AM    <DIR>          .
03/11/2019  08:26 AM    <DIR>          ..
03/11/2019  08:26 AM    <DIR>          archetypes
03/11/2019  08:26 AM                82 config.toml
03/11/2019  08:26 AM    <DIR>          content
03/11/2019  08:26 AM    <DIR>          data
03/11/2019  08:26 AM    <DIR>          layouts
03/11/2019  08:26 AM    <DIR>          static
03/11/2019  08:26 AM    <DIR>          themes
               1 File(s)             82 bytes
               8 Dir(s)  83,632,214,016 bytes free

```

## Git and GitHub
*(There may be many better ways to do this, but this WORKS for me)*

If you don't have Git installed, please follow the [Git Installation Steps]({{<relref "/blog/Git-Install.md">}}) here.


Register for GitHub if you don't have an account, once you have registered, log in with your GitHub account. On the top right of the main GitHub page click on the small down arrow and select ```Settings```.

Once in the settings menu select ```SSH and GPG keys```, and then click on ```New SSH key```.

### Generating your SSH key.

Click on the Windows start menu and select ```Git Bash```.

In the Git Bash window enter the following command to generate an SSH key:
```
# Change the email address to the one you used to sign up to GitHub!!
# Accept the default path when offered

$ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_github_email@domain.com"

Generating public/private ras key pair.

Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/user/.ssh/id_rsa)    [Press Enter to accept the default path]

Created directory '/c/Users/user/.ssh'.

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):    [Enter a password if you wish]
Enter same passphrase again: 

Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/user/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:AbCdEfG1234567jLbrOkQOYvLXxvs2gojrqvrkuKxnDb7A8 your_github_email@domain.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4029]----+
|          . =.o. |
|           + O   |
|          o = o  |
|         . +     |
|        S   .    |
|. .    +   . .   |
|oo +E  .oo  +    |
|+o. oo. =o+==    |
|*+=*+oo. =++==   |
+----[SHA256]-----+

```

Your private and public RSA key will are stored in /c/Users/user/.ssh  (Accessible via Git Bash).

```
# Change directory to .ssh and do an ls-la to see the files
$ cd .ssh
$ ls -la

total 8
-rw-r--r-- 1 user 197121 3324 Nov  3 13:54 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 user 197121  730 Nov  3 13:54 id_rsa.pub
```

You now need to copy your Public Key (id_rsa.pub) to GitHub. To see your public key run the following:
```
# show the contents of id_rsa.pub to see your public key
$ cat id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa BBBB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAAB+Bao45bJuM9DljnmwVxRjNK22SXyBIxCmiSPSAMRi/

3o4dqMtG95UCj8M45Fh7Ms90cIw5UWclNxjKrdVSyEVNzy/oftxSlw== your_github_email@domain.com
```

Go back to GitHub, enter a description in the ```Title``` field, and paste all the text into the ```Key``` field. The key should contain everything in id_rsa.key, including ssh-rsa at the beginning and your email address at the end.

Click ```Add SSH Key``` to save your key.

Test your SSH Keys with GitHub by running the following:
```
# From Git Bash run the following command to test your SSH keys with GitHub
$ ssh -T git@github.com

Hi your_github_username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

## Ubuntu 19.10 Linux Setup
In this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the "$" prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with "#" are comments that I've added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the ":wq" on the last line means to save the file.


Here's an example:

```
## this is a comment
$ echo this is a command
this is a command

## edit the file
$vi foo.md
+++
date = "2019-11-01"
title = "creating a post"
+++

Text in the post goes here....
:wq

## show it
$ cat foo.md
+++
date = "2014-09-28"
title = "creating a post"
+++

Text in the post goes here....
$
```

## Assumptions
1. You will use your "home" directory ```/home/user``` as the starting point for your new project.
2. I am using ```PasswdTest.Blog``` as the name of my site, directories, etc. Substitute your site wherever you see PasswdTest.Blog.

```

There are various other ways to install hugo, flex your <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Google-fu" target="_blank">Google-Fu</a>.

You can now try to run ```hugo --help``` again from a terminal and you should see the output above if the installation was successful.

# Creating your hugo site
Now we can start to create your site. To keep things simple we will store all our sites in the "home" directory ```/home/user``` or ```~/```. Wherever we use ```~``` in the tutorial we mean ```/home/user```, everything will be relative to that path.

```
~$ mkdir Sites

cd Sites

~/Sites$
```

Run the command to generate a new site. I am using ```PasswdTest.Blog``` as the name of the site.
```

~/Sites$ hugo new site PasswdTest.Blog


Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in C:\Hugo\Sites\PasswdTest.Blog.
